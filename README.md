# Bloc Jams

This is my repo for Bloc Jams, the first web app that I built during my web development course through <a target="_blank" href="www.bloc.io">Bloc</a>. This app was first written in JavaScript, and then completely refactored into jQuery for learning purposes.

The app was then refactored a third time in Angular JS. That repo can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rbrandty/bloc-angular">here</a>.

It's a music player with a landing page, an album collection page, and an album page that displays album data and a song list. The album page contains a control bar that enables play, pause, resume, stop, previous, next, volume, and position in a song.
This version is a demo with one album and five songs available for testing.<br>
